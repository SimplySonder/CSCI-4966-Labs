Lawsuits from big coorperations against individuals are tough to deal with. Legal fees tend to either rival or be much greater than the settlement fee, which can force people to simply settle and not be able to fight for their rights. The late 20th century and start of the 21st were a Wild West with legality and right as well as everyone being left to fend for themselves compared to the interconnected World Wide Web of today. If such an instance were to happen now, someone like Jesse could have potentially reach out to the world about this predicament and garner support to take on RIAA in court. While, big coorperations like RIAA will consistently have an advantage over everyday people like Jesse, I believe that rights for those that wish to tinker to create something that'll benefit others at no financial gain for themeselves are much more secure today, and we have the activism resulting from these past cases to attribute to these rights.
